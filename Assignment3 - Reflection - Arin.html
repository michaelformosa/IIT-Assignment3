<h2> Relection - Arin </h2>

<p> During Assignment 3 our group meetings were delayed for a while however, once we began discussing who is doing which part of the assignment, we all came to a consensus rather quickly. Each group member performed their task to high standards and made sure to attend meetings to get quick updates from each member. The use of GitHub once again made it easy to upload files for the whole team to share and collate on. The one thing I would improve would be the response time when a member asks questions on the chat and inform the other members if they were unable to attend the meetings.  The project meetings were short, but it was rather quick to gather updates on one another and allowed us to further communicate. I think throughout this semester this group worked well together as we agreed on most things and understood each otherâ€™s issues and circumstances when they were falling behind or unable to attend meetings to give updates on their progress. One awesome factor about this group would be the way our team got along even though we have not met each other in person but everyone was nice and friendly to chat and work with this semester. I would personally enjoy working with these people in the future since they are honest and smart when it come to Information Technology.
