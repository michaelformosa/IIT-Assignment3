Group Process:
</p>
<br>
<p>
I think our group worked nicely in developing our assignment and ideas to a high standard. I do think however, that we could have worked more efficiently. In many cases there would be a member missing in team meetings or group discussions, and much of our work was handed in at the last second. I hope this time we can be faster in submitting work without sacrificing the great quality demonstrated before and then all members can be more engaged and generally more on top of work. Overall, I think we did well in assignment 2 and hope to do the same in assignment 3.
