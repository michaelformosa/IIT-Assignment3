<img src="Photo - Arin.jpg" alt="self photo">
<p> My name is Arin Hua, I am also known as s3839066 and my email address is arin.hua@gmail.com. I am chinese, buddhism, finished VCE year 12 and currently study Bachelor of IT here at RMIT. I speak English and Chinese fluently and enjoy the sport badminton as it is similar to tennis but has its advantageous differences such as a smaller court. Since i was young, i have always enjoyed IT as i use it everyday for school, work and connections with mates. Previously, I have studied software development and VET IT which gave me the experience to understand the concepts of java and HTML which has significantly boosted my confidence in creating my assignments this so far year. Our team name is 1080p referencing High Definition display resolution since it relates to IT.
During assignment two, our team worked on their part of their assignment flawlessly and everyone put effort into attending microsoft teams meetings. We would all be there for each other if assistance was required and were flexible on picking up more sections of the assignment. There have been no required modifications to our career plans from the feedback of assignment two.
