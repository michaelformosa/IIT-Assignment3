<h1>Project Description</h1>

<p>Team 1080p</p>

<!---->
<HR color="black" size="2">
<h2> Overview </h2>
<p> While there are many who enjoy takeaway fast food, there are just as many people who make more health focused choices when deciding what to eat. This would be the target demographic of our home cooking app. The app will either partner with pre-established food delivery services such as Uber eats and Menulog, or have its own delivery service to deliver fresh, homemade cooking to customers doorsteps. There are many who have long since retired and too old to work who love to cook and bake. Cooking for the app would give them something they love doing to fill their free time, while also turning a profit! At the same time customers on the other side would be able to enjoy freshly baked apple pies or hot spaghetti Bolognese just like their grandparents used to make. A food delivery service where you can choose from a variety of meals prepared in everyday people’s homes and enjoy a warm hearty meal while giving back to the community and local retirees.

<h2> What does it do? </h2>
<p> Cooking: 
Meals are prepared by a cook within their own home and within their own time. A cook can prepare any number of dishes and then input into the app the name and number of prepared dishes. For example, a home cook may prepare three apple pies. They would then input into the app that three apple pies are ready for delivery at the location of their address. A user can open the app to see which meals are ready for order, and their approximate delivery times. Cooks will have ratings out of 5 stars reviewed by previous customers, allowing users to make informed choices on which meals they wish to order. 
Within the app the user would be able to sort by cuisine and with Melbourne being home to over 140 different cultures there will be no shortage of options for a variety of meals from a variety of chefs, providing seemingly endless amounts of unique foods that you can not find in a restaurant with each cook providing different and unique experiences. On top of all this, recipe cards will be delivered with each meal allowing the consumer to learn how to cook the dish and hopefully start cooking habits of their own to allow them to lead healthier lifestyles. Many current options for meals away from home are local cafes and restaurants or for the busier individual who may not be able to leave the office, ordering food delivered which in its current state is ridded with unhealthy options and forces the consumer into purchasing food that will be detrimental to their health and diet. Instead of having an oily pizza and garlic bread for lunch at the office, they could enjoy a healthier, more cost effective meal that also gives back to the community. I anticipate there will be a number of legal issues involved with providing meals cooked in inconsistent homes and without food health and safety guidelines being met but to alleviate this problem, each cook can apply to join the app and when they do, must agree to their kitchen space to be examined by professionals hired by the company to certify that the cooking conditions meet the standard in the business. This will also allow for customers to feel safe and confident in purchasing the homemade meals. 
Delivery: 
Once an order has been placed, an allocated driver will be notified, where they will pick up and then deliver the ordered meal. In the case of a partnership with a delivery company such as UberEats, the app will have access to their network of drivers for a small commission fee. Once delivered the customer can leave a review for future customers. If desired, cooks can send a recipe card along with their meal. If a customer especially enjoys the meal they order, they can learn to cook the exact same dish themselves. 
Costs:
Costs of the application would include the initial marketing campaign to attract new drivers to the business as the initial hurdle at the heart of the project is acquiring a large network of drivers that are spread throughout Melbourne for fast enough delivery to where food does not become cold or the users frustrated. This marketing could be done through cheaper methods such as listings on community notice boards or through intense online marketing and advertisements which would obviously lead to a greater acquisition of drivers but comes with its share of associated costs. Not only would marketing need to be done to attract drivers but also to attracts users and cooks, community notice boards again would be ideal for the latter option as that is where retirees may be most likely to see the adverts. Other costs would involve the creation of the application which could again be done on a budget or on a more thought out and developed approach. The application needs to be programmed and created from scratch using software such as Swift and Marvel to create the app and Pixelmator to help design logos and general design features of the app such as function buttons and menus. A computer would be needed in order to program the app as well as a smartphone in order to test the app and ensure it runs smoothly on all devices. 

Issues: 
Of course, a variety of legal issues arise from this. Unlike the professional standards of a restaurant, not every home will have ideal cooking conditions. For this reason, each cook that registers with the app will need to have their cooking station examined and inspected by professionals to insure they meet health and safety regulations. These inspections would then recur at least once a month to ensure standards are consistently met. Some cooks may also wish to keep the recipes of their dishes private, and in particularly personally dishes, some cooks may even raise copy right concerns. It wouldn’t be hard for a customer to simply copy and remake a particular dish to sell themselves. For this reason, including a recipe would be optional for cooks, but highly encouraged.

<h2> What Is The Likely Impact? </h2>
<p>
Currently, the entire world has been greatly affected by the corona virus, with many countries having their populations encouraged to stay home. Australia being one of them. In light of social distancing regulations, restaurants and cafés are now closed. Many people who would once enjoy Friday nights at their local family restaurant or meet friends at their local café now turn to takeaway food, making online delivery more popular than ever. For our target demographic, this means they can still get their traditional home cooking regardless of regulations. But it can also serve as an extra source of income for those struggling financially. One of, if not, the biggest threat facing the global economy in 2020 is the corona virus. Many have lost their jobs and are stuck at home with little to no means of earning an income. By delivering home cooking through our app, many home cooks with a passion for cooking and baking can still earn some money by selling their home cooking. It could even serve as a way for family and friends separated by social distancing to share their cooking creations. 
In the current state of the world wherein we are experiencing a pandemic that closes restaurants and forces people to isolate at home. There will be more people at home leading to more people with spare time that could be dedicated to cooking and more users that cannot leave their houses to eat out. This lays out the perfect foundation and solution to one of the biggest problems in the global economy in 2020, lack of circulation of money due to people being unable to leave their houses. Homemade cooking will circulate money around the economy, from the pockets of the users to the pockets of the cooks, boosting the economy in this time of crisis. 
The majority of cooks are expected to be retirees as this application would appeal to them the most out of any other audience. This is due to the fact that retirees have more spare time as a general rule of thumb over any other age group because they are unemployed. Many retirees also enjoy cooking and look for something to fill in their spare time while simultaneously bringing home some income so they do not have to purely rely upon their pension and/or super fund. Aside from looking for income and a pastime, many retirees seek a sense of purpose which they lack due to being unemployed, a sense of purpose that Homemade Cooking may be able to supply them with. The sense of giving back to the community and sharing their love and creations, giving them that sense of fulfilment that they seek. Melbourne is also the world’s hub of new diets and specialised diets whether that be keto, vegan diets or simply healthy eating which makes it the perfect location to roll out the app for healthy homemade meals.

<h2> How Will This Affect You? </h2>
<p>
While an app like this may not particularly have a major affect on myself personally, it would have an impact on my family. Both my parents love home cooking and baking, and almost all our meals are home cooked. With the use of this home cooking service my parents could turn their cooking passions into extra profits. More so, it would provide an easy way for my parents to share their home cooking with other family and friends. During the covid pandemic its not exactly easy to visit other people, and for my family they also love sharing their food with others. With the app they can deliver their meals to friends and family, and have others do the same.
Some of my close friends on the other hand have parents who are too busy or not as passionate about home cooking. They don’t get to eat home cooked meals as often. While it isn’t always the case, this can sometimes end up in simply ordering fast food out of convenience. With the home cooking delivery app however, they can always eat home cooking even if it means ordering from someone else. This is almost always a healthier alternative than just ordering from the nearest take away. If they have specific preferences or are just feeling experimental, they would also have a huge of variety of meals from all the different cultural backgrounds of home cooks that would join the app.
In my own home it means I could try home cooked foods from other cultures that I may not have otherwise had, or had been able to order from a fast food or takeaway restaurant. In general, the app would help improve the health and variety in food ordered by its users, while also providing a means for friends and family to share their own cooking creations.
