<h1>Group processes and communications</h1>

<p>Team 1080p</p>

<h2> Non-recorded communications: </h2>
<p> Virtually all communication between group members not formally recorded through group meetings will be recorded in the Microsoft Team’s messages. All messages from group members related to assignments and coursework are done through the team’s messenger. Any communication not relevant to the assignment is usually done elsewhere, likely through social media. This is also used in the case a team member is not responding or missing in teams. A member will attempt to reach them through alternative communication such as Facebook etc.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Meeting Schedule: </h2>
<p> The group plans to meet at least twice a week, however, since our group is comprised of six individual members it’s difficult to lock down a specific time slot that works for everyone, due to other assignments and tests that get in the way. This is especially true as we near the end of the semester. Because of this, the meeting times usually fluctuate between whenever as many members are available rather than a rigorous schedule. Unfortunately, there have been a couple meetings in which a group member wasn’t able to show up or was missing from teams.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Contacting missing members: </h2>
<p>
As mentioned before, in the case of a missing group member, an alternative messaging app is used such as Facebook. Despite changing schedules, we try to organise a date and time for a meeting at least a day in advance to give group members the chance to add it to their schedule. In the case a member is unable to attend or doesn’t respond to messages on teams or Facebook than the meeting is held without them. Notes are kept on each meeting so members can be informed of the details regarding the meeting they missed.
