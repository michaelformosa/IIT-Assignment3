<h3> Testing </h3>
<p> During our design and development stages of our project, our group will be conducting numerous tests to ensure the stability and objective are upheld, combining these tests together, it will allow us to maintain the users satisfaction with the Home-Fresh food delivery application while giving us an overview of our progression. Throughout development, we will be ensuring that our compatibility with certain platforms and mobile operating systems will be supported, our graphical user interface (GUI) will remain clean and provide easy steps when ordering food, the usability of the app is friendly and easy to navigate, finally, we will be organising as well as supervising user tests with selected individuals  to receive a report for improvements and bugs.</p>
<p>Every application should be available on most, if not all types of devices, whether it be a computer, mobile, or even a tablet. Compatibility testing ensures these applications are supported and are rolled out to all platforms in order to attract users regardless of the device they are currently using which combats hindering the features and services provided by the Home-Fresh app. Many types of compatibility testing will be conducted during the development of the project, those of which are operating systems, mobile platforms and browser compatibility tests. The easiest method and most appropriate to test compatibility is to run the application on their respected operating system, mobile platform and browser to compare their functionalities between them. After we obtain the test results, we will further research our most suitable option and continue to develop further into that platform or browser which gives us an insight into our future target audience.  </p>
<p> The main purpose of usability testing is focusing around three points, the ease of use, Ease of Learning or familiarizing with the system, and the satisfaction of the user after experiencing the features of the Home-Fresh app. Usability testing performs a major analysis into the users ease when navigating around the app but also the user-friendliness. There are many methods to conduct usability testing, they range from a design of the app on paper, to site designs and wireframes. Our most likely approach would be site designs and wireframes since we share our ideas and files online already. A successful completion of this usability testing will be admitted once we discover the negatives to our design and once we improve it to match a user-friendly and ease of confusion layout.
Similar to usability testing, GUI testing highlights the ease of navigation around an application to ensure an efficient and effective method to utilise the features and functions of an app. Our most effective method to test a graphical user interface test would be to release screenshots of wireframes which contain the interface users will encounter when using the app. Upon gathering feedback, a distinct review will be held to perform any modifications required to the design of the interface, upon completion, we may confirm an accomplishment to our GUI testing.</p>

<p>Our project will consist of user testing which allows a fixed number of individuals to test the beta version of Home-Fresh and provide feedback to any improvements. The best method to user testing is observation, this when we present a number of tasks to the participant and observe their move without providing hints or directions. Observation will be our main method when performing our user testing as it grants us the most informative information when adjusting improvements. This will also grant us certainty into what the difficult concepts are, if any, and provide us with a successful test once we receive no confusion from the participants. Situated around the city campus, there will be plenty of other university students around, there will be office workers, or even families who are all eligible to provide feedback for this user test. We aim to test individuals from all sorts of occupations and daily lives, as well as people from different backgrounds since the culinary world is widely multi cultural. An exact number of testers isnâ€™t clear yet, however our goal would be to test as many people from different cultures, backgrounds and occupations as needed.  </p>
